# Sort by Last Char 7kyu
# Given a string of words (x), you need to return an array of the words, sorted alphabetically by the final character in each.
# If two words have the same last letter, they returned array should show them in the order they appeared in the given string.
# All inputs will be valid.

# Filter the number 7kyu
# Oh no! The number has been mixed up with the text. Your goal is to retreive the number from the text, can you return the number back to it's original state?

# Your task is to return a number from a string.

# Going to the cinema 7kyu
# My friend John likes to go to the cinema. He can choose between system A and system B.
# System A : buy a ticket (15 dollars) every time
# System B : buy a card (500 dollars) and every time
# buy a ticket the price of which is 0.90 times the price he paid for the previous one.
# # Example:
# # If John goes to the cinema 3 times:
# # System A : 15 * 3 = 45
# # System B : 500 + 15 * 0.90 + (15 * 0.90) * 0.90 = 536.5849999999999
# # John should go to the cinema system B.
# # The function movie has 3 parameters: card (price of the card), ticket (normal price of a ticket), perc (fraction of what he paid for the previous ticket) and returns the first n such that
# # ceil(price of System B) < price of System A.
# # More examples:
# # movie(500, 15, 0.9) should return 43 
# # (with card the total price is 634, with tickets 645)
# # movie(100, 10, 0.95) should return 24
# # (with card the total price is 235, with tickets 240)

# Simple remove duplicates 7kyu
# Remove the duplicates from a list of integers, keeping the last ( rightmost ) occurrence of each element.
# # Example:

# #   -- remove the first 3
# #   -- remove 4 because it occurs twice

# Over The Road 7kyu
# You've just moved into a perfectly straight street with exactly n identical houses on either side of the road. Naturally, you would like to find out the house number of the people on the other side of the street. The street looks something like this:
# Street
# 1|   |6
# 3|   |4
# 5|   |2
# 7|   |0
# Even numbers increase on the right; odd numbers decrease on the left. House numbers start at 0 and increase without gaps. When n = 3, 1 is opposite 6, 3 opposite 4, and 5 opposite 2.
# # Example
# Given your house number address and length of street n, give the house number on the opposite side of the street.
# # over_the_road(address, n)
# # over_the_road(1, 3) = 6
# # over_the_road(3, 3) = 4

# A Rule of Divisibility by 7 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/55e6f5e58f7817808e00002e/train/ruby
# A number m of the form 10x + y is divisible by 7 if and only if x âˆ’ 2y is divisible by 7.
# In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits.
# Continue to do this until a number known to be divisible or not by 7 is obtained;
# you can stop when this number has at most 2 digits because you are supposed to know
# if a number of at most 2 digits is divisible by 7 or not.
# The original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the last number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7.
# Examples:
#   1 - m = 371 -> 37 âˆ’ (2Ã—1) -> 37 âˆ’ 2 = 35; thus, since 35 is divisible by 7, 371 is divisible by 7.
#  The number of steps to get the result is 1.
#   2 - m = 1603 -> 160 - (2 x 3) -> 154 -> 15 - 8 = 7, and 7 is divisible by 7.
#  3 - m = 372 -> 37 âˆ’ (2Ã—2) -> 37 âˆ’ 4 = 33; thus, since 33 is not divisible by 7, 372 is not divisible by 7.
# The number of steps to get the result is 1.
#   4 - m = 477557101->47755708->4775554->477547->47740->4774->469->28
# and 28 is divisible by 7, so is 477557101. The number of steps is 7.
# Task:
# Your task is to return to the function seven(m) (m integer >= 0) an array
# (or a pair, depending on the language) of numbers, the first being the last number m
# with at most 2 digits obtained by your function (this last m will be divisible or not by 7),
# the second one being the number of steps to get the result.
# seven(371) should return [35, 1]
# seven(1603) should return [7, 2]
# seven(477557101) should return [28, 7]

# The Office III - Broken Photocopier 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/57ed56657b45ef922300002b/train/ruby
# The bloody photocopier is broken... Just as you were sneaking around the office to print off your favourite binary code!
# Instead of copying the original, it reverses it: '1' becomes '0' and vice versa.
# Given a string of binary, return the version the photocopier gives you as a string.

# Simple string characters 7kyu

# In this Kata, you will be given a string and your task will be to return a list of ints detailing the count of uppercase letters, lowercase, numbers and special characters, as follows.
# Solve("*'&ABCDabcde12345") = [4,5,5,3].
# --the order is: uppercase letters, lowercase, numbers and special characters.

# Remove All The Marked Elements of a List 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/563089b9b7be03472d00002b/train/ruby
# We need a method in the List Class that may remove from a given list of integers, all the values contained in a second list.
# The method remove_() will accept two arguments, a list of an uncertain amount of integers, integer_list
# and a second list that contains integer values, too, values_list.
# The method will output a list with all the integers that are not in values_list
# Like the following:
# integer_list =  [1, 1, 2 ,3 ,1 ,2 ,3 ,4]
# values_list = [1, 3]
# remove_(integer_list, values_list) == [2, 2, 4]
# Enjoy it!!
class Array
  def remove_(integer_list, values_list)
    integer_list.reject { |num| values_list.include?(num) }

# Product Of Maximums Of Array (Array Series #2) 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a63948acadebff56f000018/train/ruby
# Introduction and Warm-up (Highly recommended)
# Playing With Lists/Arrays Series
# Task
# Given an array/list [] of integers , Find the product of the k maximal numbers.
# Notes
# Array/list size is at least 3 .
# Array/list's numbers Will be mixture of positives , negatives and zeros
# Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur.
# Input >> Output Examples
# maxProduct ({4, 3, 5}, 2) ==>  return (20)
# Explanation:
# Since the size (k) equal 2 , then the subsequence of size 2 whose gives product of maxima is 5 * 4 = 20 .
# maxProduct ({8, 10 , 9, 7}, 3) ==>  return (720)
# Explanation:
# Since the size (k) equal 3 , then the subsequence of size 2 whose gives product of maxima is 8 * 9 * 10 = 720 .
# maxProduct ({10, 8, 3, 2, 1, 4, 10}, 5) ==> return (9600)
# Explanation:
# Since the size (k) equal 5 , then the subsequence of size 2 whose gives product of maxima is 10 * 10 * 8 * 4 * 3 = 9600 .
