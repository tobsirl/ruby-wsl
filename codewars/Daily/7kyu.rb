# Sort by Last Char 7kyu
# Given a string of words (x), you need to return an array of the words, sorted alphabetically by the final character in each.
# If two words have the same last letter, they returned array should show them in the order they appeared in the given string.
# All inputs will be valid.
def last(x)
  x.split.sort_by { |word| word[-1] }
end

# Filter the number 7kyu
# Oh no! The number has been mixed up with the text. Your goal is to retreive the number from the text, can you return the number back to it's original state?
# Task
# Your task is to return a number from a string.
def FilterString(string)
  string.gsub(/\D/, '').to_i
end

# Maximum Triplet Sum (Array Series #7)
# Task
# Given an array/list [] of n integers , find maximum triplet sum in the array Without duplications .
def max_tri_sum(numbers)
  numbers.uniq.max(3).sum
end

# Going to the cinema 7kyu
# My friend John likes to go to the cinema. He can choose between system A and system B.
# System A : buy a ticket (15 dollars) every time
# System B : buy a card (500 dollars) and every time
# buy a ticket the price of which is 0.90 times the price he paid for the previous one.
# # Example:
# # If John goes to the cinema 3 times:
# # System A : 15 * 3 = 45
# # System B : 500 + 15 * 0.90 + (15 * 0.90) * 0.90 = 536.5849999999999
# # John should go to the cinema system B.
# # The function movie has 3 parameters: card (price of the card), ticket (normal price of a ticket), perc (fraction of what he paid for the previous ticket) and returns the first n such that
# # ceil(price of System B) < price of System A.
# # More examples:
# # movie(500, 15, 0.9) should return 43 
# # (with card the total price is 634, with tickets 645)
# # movie(100, 10, 0.95) should return 24
# # (with card the total price is 235, with tickets 240)
def movie(card, ticket, perc)
  n = 0
  a = 0
  b = card
  while b.ceil >= a
    n += 1
    a += ticket
    b += ticket * perc**n
  end
  n
end

# Simple remove duplicates 7kyu
# Remove the duplicates from a list of integers, keeping the last ( rightmost ) occurrence of each element.
# # Example:
# #   solve([3, 4, 4, 3, 6, 3]) # => [4, 6, 3]
# #   -- remove the first 3
# #   -- remove 4 because it occurs twice
# #   -- remove the second 3
def solve(arr)
  arr.reverse.uniq.reverse
end

# Over The Road 7kyu
# You've just moved into a perfectly straight street with exactly n identical houses on either side of the road. Naturally, you would like to find out the house number of the people on the other side of the street. The street looks something like this:
# Street
# 1|   |6
# 3|   |4
# 5|   |2
# 7|   |0
# Even numbers increase on the right; odd numbers decrease on the left. House numbers start at 0 and increase without gaps. When n = 3, 1 is opposite 6, 3 opposite 4, and 5 opposite 2.
# # Example
# Given your house number address and length of street n, give the house number on the opposite side of the street.
# # over_the_road(address, n)
# # over_the_road(1, 3) = 6
# # over_the_road(3, 3) = 4
# # over_the_road(2, 3) = 5
# # over_the_road(3, 5) = 8
def over_the_road(address, n)
  2 * n + 1 - address
