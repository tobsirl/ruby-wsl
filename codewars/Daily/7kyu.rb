# Sort by Last Char 7kyu
# Given a string of words (x), you need to return an array of the words, sorted alphabetically by the final character in each.
# If two words have the same last letter, they returned array should show them in the order they appeared in the given string.
# All inputs will be valid.

# Going to the cinema 7kyu
# My friend John likes to go to the cinema. He can choose between system A and system B.
# System A : buy a ticket (15 dollars) every time
# System B : buy a card (500 dollars) and every time
# buy a ticket the price of which is 0.90 times the price he paid for the previous one.
# # Example:
# # If John goes to the cinema 3 times:
# # System A : 15 * 3 = 45
# # System B : 500 + 15 * 0.90 + (15 * 0.90) * 0.90 = 536.5849999999999
# # John should go to the cinema system B.
# # The function movie has 3 parameters: card (price of the card), ticket (normal price of a ticket), perc (fraction of what he paid for the previous ticket) and returns the first n such that
# # ceil(price of System B) < price of System A.
# # More examples:
# # movie(500, 15, 0.9) should return 43 
# # (with card the total price is 634, with tickets 645)
# # movie(100, 10, 0.95) should return 24
# # (with card the total price is 235, with tickets 240)

# Over The Road 7kyu
# You've just moved into a perfectly straight street with exactly n identical houses on either side of the road. Naturally, you would like to find out the house number of the people on the other side of the street. The street looks something like this:
# Street
# 1|   |6
# 3|   |4
# 5|   |2
# 7|   |0
# Even numbers increase on the right; odd numbers decrease on the left. House numbers start at 0 and increase without gaps. When n = 3, 1 is opposite 6, 3 opposite 4, and 5 opposite 2.
# # Example
# Given your house number address and length of street n, give the house number on the opposite side of the street.
# # over_the_road(address, n)
# # over_the_road(1, 3) = 6
# # over_the_road(3, 3) = 4

# A Rule of Divisibility by 7 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/55e6f5e58f7817808e00002e/train/ruby
# A number m of the form 10x + y is divisible by 7 if and only if x âˆ’ 2y is divisible by 7.
# In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits.
# Continue to do this until a number known to be divisible or not by 7 is obtained;
# you can stop when this number has at most 2 digits because you are supposed to know
# if a number of at most 2 digits is divisible by 7 or not.
# The original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the last number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7.
# Examples:
#   1 - m = 371 -> 37 âˆ’ (2Ã—1) -> 37 âˆ’ 2 = 35; thus, since 35 is divisible by 7, 371 is divisible by 7.
#  The number of steps to get the result is 1.
#   2 - m = 1603 -> 160 - (2 x 3) -> 154 -> 15 - 8 = 7, and 7 is divisible by 7.
#  3 - m = 372 -> 37 âˆ’ (2Ã—2) -> 37 âˆ’ 4 = 33; thus, since 33 is not divisible by 7, 372 is not divisible by 7.
# The number of steps to get the result is 1.
#   4 - m = 477557101->47755708->4775554->477547->47740->4774->469->28
# and 28 is divisible by 7, so is 477557101. The number of steps is 7.
# Task:
# Your task is to return to the function seven(m) (m integer >= 0) an array
# (or a pair, depending on the language) of numbers, the first being the last number m
# with at most 2 digits obtained by your function (this last m will be divisible or not by 7),
# the second one being the number of steps to get the result.
# seven(371) should return [35, 1]
# seven(1603) should return [7, 2]

# Digital cypher 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/592e830e043b99888600002d/train/ruby
# Introduction
# Digital Cypher assigns to each letter of the alphabet unique number. For example:
#  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m
#  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13

#  14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
# Instead of letters in encrypted word we write the corresponding number, eg. The word scout:
#  s  c  o  u  t
# 19  3 15 21 20
# Then we add to each obtained digit consecutive digits from the key. For example. In case of key equal to 1939 :
#   s  c  o  u  t
#  19  3 15 21 20
# + 1  9  3  9  1
#  ---------------
#  20 12 18 30 21

#  --------------------------------
#  14 10 22 29  6 27 19 18  6  12 8
# Task
# Write a function that accepts str string and key number and returns an array of integers representing encoded str.
# Input / Output
# The str input string consists of lowercase characters only.

# By 3, or not by 3? That is the question . . . 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f7fc109f0e86d705000043/train/ruby
# A trick I learned in elementary school to determine whether or not a number was divisible by three is to add all of the integers in the number together and to divide the resulting sum by three.
# If there is no remainder from dividing the sum by three, then the original number is divisible by three as well.
# Given a series of numbers as a string, determine if the number represented by the string is divisible by three.
# You can expect all test case arguments to be strings representing values greater than 0.
# Example:
# '123' // true
# '8409' // true
# '100853' // false
# '33333333' // true
# '7' // false

# Valid Spacing 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/5f77d62851f6bc0033616bd8/train/ruby
# Task
# Your task is to write a function called valid_spacing() or validSpacing() which checks if a string has valid spacing.
# The function should return either True or False.
# For this kata, the definition of valid spacing is one space between words, and no leading or trailing spaces.
# Below are some examples of what the function should return.
# 'Hello world' = true
# ' Hello world' = false
# 'Hello world  ' = false
# 'Hello  world' = false
# 'Hello' = true
# Even though there are no spaces, it is still valid because none are needed
# 'Helloworld' = true
# ' ' = false
# '' = true
def valid_spacing(s)
  s == s.split(' ').join(' ')

# Stanton measure 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/59a1cdde9f922b83ee00003b/train/ruby
# The Stanton measure of an array is computed as follows: count the number of 1s in the array. Let this count be n. The Stanton measure is the number of times that n appears in the array.
# Write a function which takes an integer array and returns its Stanton measure.
# Example:
# The Stanton measure of [1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2] is 3, because 1 occurs 2 times in the array and 2 occurs 3 times.
def stanton_measure(arr)

# String Merge! 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/597bb84522bc93b71e00007e/train/ruby
# Given two words and a letter, return a single word that's a combination of both words, 
# merged at the point where the given letter first appears in each word. 
# The returned word should have the beginning of the first word and the ending of the second, 
# with the dividing letter in the middle. You can assume both words will contain the dividing letter.
# Examples
# StringMerge("hello", "world", "l")       ==>  "held"
# StringMerge("coding", "anywhere", "n")   ==>  "codinywhere"
# StringMerge("jason", "samson", "s")      ==>  "jasamson"
# StringMerge("wonderful", "people", "e")  ==>  "wondeople"

# Difference Of Squares 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/558f9f51e85b46e9fa000025/train/ruby
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers (1 <= n <= 100) and the square of their sum.
# Example
# For example, when n = 10:
# The square of the sum of the numbers is:
# (1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025
# The sum of the squares of the numbers is:
# 1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385
# Hence the difference between square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of those numbes is: 3025 - 385 = 2640

# This kata is the first of a sequence of four about "Squared Strings".
# You are given a string of n lines, each substring being n characters long: For example:
# s = "abcd\nefgh\nijkl\nmnop"
# We will study some transformations of this square of strings.
# Vertical mirror: vert_mirror (or vertMirror or vert-mirror)

# Say hello! 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/55955a48a4e9c1a77500005a/train/ruby
# Say hello!
# Write a function to greet a person. Function will take name as input and greet the person by saying hello. 
# Return null/nil if input is empty string or null/nil.
# Example:

# Drone Fly-By 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/58356a94f8358058f30004b5/train/ruby
# The other day I saw an amazing video where a guy hacked some wifi controlled lightbulbs by flying a drone past them. Brilliant.
# In this kata we will recreate that stunt... sort of.
# You will be given two strings: lamps and drone. Lamps represents a row of lamps, currently off, each represented by 'x'. When these lamps are on, they should be represented by 'o'.
# The drone string represents the position of the drone 'T' (any better suggestion for character??) and its flight path up until this point '='. The drone always flies left to right, and always begins at the start of the row of lamps. Anywhere the drone has flown, including its current position, will result in the lamp at that position switching on.
# Return the resulting lamps string. See example tests for more clarity.
# FUNDAMENTALS

# A Nice array is defined to be an array where for every value n in the array, there is also an element n-1 or n+1 in the array.
# example:
# [2,10,9,3] is Nice array because
# 2=3-1
# 10=9+1
# 3=2+1
# 9=10-1
# Write a function named isNice/IsNice that returns true if its array argument is a Nice array, else false. You should also return false if input array has no elements.

# Simple consecutive pairs 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a3e1319b6486ac96f000049/train/ruby
# In this Kata your task will be to return the count of pairs that have consecutive numbers as follows:
# pairs([1,2,5,8,-4,-3,7,6,5]) = 3
# The pairs are selected as follows [(1,2),(5,8),(-4,-3),(7,6),5]
# --the first pair is (1,2) and the numbers in the pair are consecutive; Count = 1
# --the second pair is (5,8) and are not consecutive
# --the third pair is (-4,-3), consecutive. Count = 2
# --the fourth pair is (7,6), also consecutive. Count = 3.
# --the last digit has no pair, so we ignore.
# More examples in the test cases.
# Good luck!

# Arithmetic progression 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/55caf1fd8063ddfa8e000018/train/ruby
# In your class, you have started lessons about arithmetic progression. Since you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function that will return the first n elements of the sequence with the given common difference d and first element a. Note that the difference may be zero!
# The result should be a string of numbers, separated by comma and space.
# Example
# # first element: 1, difference: 2, how many: 5
# arithmetic_sequence_elements(1, 2, 5) == "1, 3, 5, 7, 9"

# Minimum Steps (Array Series #6) 7kyu
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a91a7c5fd8c061367000002/train/ruby
# Task
# Given an array of N integers, you have to find how many times you have to add up the smallest numbers in the array until their Sum becomes greater or equal to K.
# Notes:
# List size is at least 3.
# All numbers will be positive.
# Numbers could occur more than once , (Duplications may exist).
# Threshold K will always be reachable.
# Input >> Output Examples
# minimumSteps({1, 10, 12, 9, 2, 3}, 6)  ==>  return (2)
# Explanation:
# We add two smallest elements (1 + 2), their sum is 3 .
# Then we add the next smallest number to it (3 + 3) , so the sum becomes 6 .
# Now the result is greater or equal to 6 , Hence the output is (2) i.e (2) operations are required to do this .
